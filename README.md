# School mini program
This here is my first work in java for college.

This work is basically about a certain school that want to create and store data for the current students.
Like their name, number and which is the class they belong.
And then store the marks for diferent subjects with that calculate the final mark, and show to the user.

Every line of code is post in here.
Have fun with that, hope it helps.
